Instructions to Set up and Run Project:
Instructions to set up in PyCharm:
First, download and install PostgreSQL on your computer. Then, create a database called stayfit_db using the command line or PGAdmin4 (PostgreSQL manager). Then clone the repository from Github into PyCharm. Input your user and password into the init_db.py and app.py files at the top. Then, run init_db.py by itself. Then, run the configuration called “flask”. While “flask” is running, also run the configuration called “dev”. Then, open the link given in the output after running “dev”. This should send you to the locally hosted url and connect with both Flask and React.
Make sure to have the user and password for the PostgreSQL database ready. This needs to be inputted correctly into the init_db.py and app.py files, otherwise it won’t run.
We also are connected to an events API with TicketMaster.
